## ❔ **Description**

A basic user directory that stores employee info in a searchable database. This database is imported from a third-party source.

## 💡 **Assignment Instructions**

For this assignment, you'll create a employee directory with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## 📌 **Assignment Requirements**

- [x] Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user should be able to:

  - [x] * Sort the table by at least one category

  - [x] * Filter the users by at least one property. 

## 🔲 **Objective**

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. 
It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## 🔑 **Usage**

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
